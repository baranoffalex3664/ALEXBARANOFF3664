			<h1>History/concept</h1>
			<div class="imgbox">
			</div>
			<p><strong>Water polo is a competitive team sport played in the water between two teams. The game consists of four quarters, in which the two teams attempt to score goals by throwing the ball into their opponent's goal. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match. Each team made up of six field players and one goalkeeper, with typically six additional players available for substitution throughout the match. Except for the goalkeeper, players participate in both offensive and defensive roles.</strong></p>
			
			<p>The game is thought to have originated in Scotland in the late 19th century as a sort of "water rugby". William Wilson is thought to have developed the game during a similar period. The game thus developed with the formation of the London Water Polo League and has since expanded, becoming widely popular in various places around the world, including Europe, the United States, Brazil, China, Canada and Australia.</p>

			<h1>My Expirience</h1>
			<div class="imgbox">

      <h1>Colorado water polo</h1>

			<p><strong>Grier was born and raised in Colorado. His natural swimming ability showed early as he set many age-group swimming state records. He still holds the 50 backstroke record for boys eight and under.
His swimming prowess only increased as he got older. While swimming for Cherry Creek High School he earned All-American honors 11 times. Grier was part of 3 team state championships, and he won numerous state titles in relays while at Cherry Creek.

Grier was accepted to Dartmouth and became captain of the varsity swim team there. This is also where he was first exposed to water polo, playing for the Dartmouth College club team. He loved the challenge of playing water polo and the change it gave him from his usual swimming workouts.

Grier coached youth and high school swimming in the Aurora area, coaching for the Falcon Aquatic Club and Eaglecrest High School. He coached nine All-American swimmers and one National Champion. In 2003, while coaching as an assistant at Grandview, Grier pulled together eight boys from Aurora-area high schools and formed a club. It was a member of that first group who came up with the name, Pirates. Since that time, Grier worked to share the sport with boys and girls in the Denver-metro area. In recent years, Grier started youth leagues so younger kids could try it out. Grier felt the toughness of the game helped build character, and helped prevent burnout for year-round swimmers.

Grier always brought a great combination of hard work and humor to practices. He loved teasing with our players, and enjoyed them teasing him back. He shared fun stories and lines from his favorite movies.

Grier cared about the players outside of the water, getting to know about other aspects of their lives. He was an excellent mentor and role model. He was always available to offer advice and enjoyed writing reference letters for jobs or colleges or college sports teams.

More importantly, Grier was a loving husband to his wife, Karen, and a very proud father to his three children. He would sometimes bring Addison, Caroline and little Grier to a practice. It was always fun to see the huge smile on his face when his kids were with him.

Thank you, Grier, for getting it all started, for being a good friend and role model. You were taken from us far too soon. We miss you..</strong></p>
